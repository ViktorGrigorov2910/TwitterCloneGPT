<h3>TwitterClone Android App</h3>

This is a simple Android app project for a Twitter clone, built using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. It includes a home screen with a list of trending tweets, and a bottom navigation bar for navigating to different screens.

 <h3>Technologies used</h3>

Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, ChatGPT

 <h3>Description</h3>
This is a side project that I'm working on to test the limits of AI technology. With the help of ChatGPT, a language model trained by OpenAI, based on the GPT-3.5 architecture, I'm building an Android app that mimics the functionalities of Twitter.

At the moment, the project is a work in progress, but my goal is to create a fully-functional Twitter clone using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. The app will have features such as home feed, trending topics, messaging, and user profiles.

I'm excited to see how far I can push the capabilities of ChatGPT and explore the possibilities of AI-powered app development. Stay tuned for updates as I continue to work on this project!

 <h3>Acknowledgments</h3>
This project was inspired by the official Twitter app.
Thanks to the OpenAI team for developing the ChatGPT language model used to build this app.

 <h3>Screens</h3>
 Some are semi-done, others not started but It will be good to keep track of the screens that are done. 
 I will try to update after the screens are done (atleast from UI perspective).
